Changelog for nfcpy
===================

0.13.5 (2018-05-19)
-------------------

* Raise TagCommandError when NDEF data could not be written to the
  tag. Previously this was captured within the tag memory cache for
  Type1Tag and Type2Tag and only raised as IndexError.

* Improved and corrected documentation for libusb Windows DLL
  installation (thanks to @ghxbob for PR #95 and @henrycjc for PR
  #112).

* Identify Raspberry Pi via device tree model file (instead of
  /proc/cpuinfo).

* Allow debug logs with `python -m nfc -verbose` to ease bug reporting
  when reader enumeration fails.

0.13.4 (2017-11-10)
-------------------

* Raise nfc.tag.TagCommandError when NDEF data could not be written to
  the tag. Previously this was captured within the tag memory cache
  for Type1Tag and Type2Tag and raised as IndexError.

0.13.3 (2017-11-02)
-------------------

* Corrects a documentation error about the errors parameter that is
  not used for ndeflib.message_decoder() as wrongly stated in a docstr
  embedded code example.

0.13.2 (2017-07-12)
-------------------

* Fixes issue #73 "Importing termios prevents operation on Windows" by
  catching the import error that occurs when running on a non-posix
  system.

0.13.1 (2017-07-01)
-------------------

* Restructured serial device discovery to find USB serial device nodes
  on Mac OS X.

* Increased regression test coverage.

0.13.0 (2017-03-27)
-------------------

* This is a maintenance release to further replace the ndef submodule
  with ndeflib, now used by a couple of documentation examples
  verified with doctest.

* Part of this release is a large number of regression tests run with
  pytest. Some minor source code changes are the result of testing and
  preparative work towards future Python 3 compatibility.

0.12.0 (2017-01-04)
-------------------

* Release 0.12 marks the end of code-transfer from Launchpad to Github
  (and bazaar to git). The Launchpad site will stay for questions and
  answers.

* Release 0.12 also marks the begin of some code separation, starting
  with inclusion of the separate NDEF decoder/encoder module from
  https://github.com/nfcpy/ndeflib when installing from PyPI or
  running `setup.py`. The `Tag.ndef` attribute's new `records` member
  uses the new ndeflib for decode and encode.

* New module main function for "python -m nfc" searches for locally
  connected contactless devices and provides diagnostic output for
  some known issues with access rights and conflicting drivers.

* New `iterations` and `interval` options allow more fine tuning of
  the polling loop in `ContactlessFrontend.connect()`.

* New `beep-on-connect` option and implementation to let an ACR-122
  blink and sound when a card is detected. Contributed by
  https://github.com/svvitale

* Ability to apply factory format completely empty NTAG tags.

* Correct dump of FeliCa Mobile data structures and timeout tuning for
  some older FeliCa cards.

* A fix for the Raspberry Pi's erratic USB implementation, see
  https://github.com/nfcpy/nfcpy/wiki/USB-TTL-serial-adapter-on-Raspberry-Pi

* A number of bug fixes, source code and documentation improvements
  including contributions by GitHub members https://github.com/pyrog,
  https://github.com/Skylled and https://github.com/hideo54.

0.11.1 (2016-04-29)
-------------------

* Fixes an error in in the authentication procedure for Ultralight-C
  and NTAG21x Type 2 Tags.

0.11.0 (2016-04-21)
-------------------

* The main new feature of release 0.11 is the support for encrypted
  LLCP connections from the NFC Forum LLCP 1.3 Specification. The
  feature is available for Linux systems with OpenSSL crypto library
  (probably all). Encryption is automatically used if the supported by
  the peer device.

* The Python USB library has changed from PyUSB to the libusb1
  module (pip install libusb1). This allows to wait for a USB
  response packet and still being able to cancel with keyboard
  interrupt (which PyUSB was unfortunately blocking).

* Starting with this release the nfcpy library part (the nfc module
  but not the examples) will be uploaded to the Python Package Index
  for simple installation with 'pip install nfcpy'.
  
* The Type 2 Tag sector_select command could finally be tested with an
  NTAG I2C Tag and is now working as intended.

0.10.2 (2015-10-02)
-------------------

* Fixes an initialization issue when PN532 is connected to serial port
  on Raspberry Pi.

0.10.1 (2015-09-28)
-------------------

* Issue warning when nfc/clf/pn53x.py is atttempted to be used as a
  driver (since version 0.10 pn53x contains only an abstract base
  class, drivers are in pn531.py/pn532.py/pn533.py).

* Fixed an issue with PN532 deactivation - the chip needs additional
  time after change of serial baudrate before the next command may be
  send.

0.10.0 (2015-07-27)
-------------------

* Complete update of the tag read/write implementation to support
  features of specific tag products, such as password protection for
  Sony FeliCa Lite-S and NXP NTAG.

* Type 4B Tags (ISO Tags) are now supported. This completes support
  for all NFC Forum Tag Types.

* All contactless driver implementation is updated for generally more
  stability and an improved low-level API. The contactless frontend
  interface class and all ddrivers are now in one sub-package and emit
  debug messages with the logger "nfc.clf".

* The TTA/TTB/TTF/DEP communication types are replaced by RemoteTarget
  and LocalTarget types with enclosed communication parameters that
  allow more control of the discovery process. This change is only
  relevant for application code that has set specifc poll targets or
  implemented card emulation code, otherwise it won't be noticed.

* The contactless frontend connect() method understands some more
  options for callbacks and peer to peer communication settings.

* Serial (tty) readers can be automatically discovered by probing
  ports and drivers. On Linux, the maximum serial baudrate is checked
  and configured up to 921.6 kbaud (with a PN532). Note that automatic
  port and driver discovery may disturb other serial devices and
  should only be used if that is not a concern.
  
* New example tools use use the low-level driver API for very specific
  tasks like pure remote target discovery (with the option to do this
  repeatedly), listen to become discovered, and to simply observe when
  an external RF field is switched on and off (requires a PN531/2/3).

* The tagtool.py and beam.py tools can inspect frequently encountered
  permission problems and output targeted recommendations for solving
  them.

* Among other updates the documentation now gives more info about
  device capabilities on both the overview page as well as in the
  drivers section.

0.9.2 (2015-02-03)
------------------

* Fixes bug lp:1274973 "acr122 driver throws exception on frame length check"

0.9.1 (2014-02-13)
------------------

* Fixes bug lp:1279271 "error reading type 1 tag with more than 120 bytes"

0.9.0 (2014-01-31)
------------------
